==================
Recruitable Bards
==================
- LUTE:
	- Strumak gro-Bol (Madach Tradehouse, Gnisis)
		Hire cost: 300G
		An unusually introspective Orc who found solace in the lute after a "disagreement" with his stronghold. Speaks little, but his music is very expressive. Might occasionally grumble about how "true strength is found in accepting sorrow."
	- Seradette of Cheydinhal (Lucky Lockup, Balmora)
		Hire cost: 1500G
		A former Imperial court performer slumming it in Morrowind for “artistic freedom.” Constantly name-drops nobility no one here has heard of. Possesses considerable talent, but questionable renown.

- OCARINA:
	- Sees-Silent-Reeds (Arrille's Tradehouse, Seyda Neen)
		Hire cost: 100G
		A calm and patient Argonian who offers cryptic but gentle advice. Claims to have learned all they know from watching the reeds on the shores of the Bitter Coast. Fascinated by the player's journey as an outlander.
	- Elara Endre (Mages Guild, Ald'ruhn)
		Hire cost: 250G
		A Breton Mages Guild initiate who finds mathematical beauty in musical scales and modes. Plays her ocarina with precise, almost clinical skill, using it to "explore tonal relationships." Offers to join because she sees the player's band as a "fascinating practical application of harmonic theory." Slightly socially awkward.

- FLUTE:
	- Sargon Assinabi (Varo Tradehouse, Vos)
		Hire cost: ~200G?
		A recenty exiled Ashlander who left his tribe with his flute as one of his few possessions, and has decided to try to find a place in settled culture. Attempting to build a life as a wandering musician, but finding settled folk have little appreciation for solo flutists.
	- Yisra (Six Fishes, Ebonheart)
		Hire cost: 400G
		A Redguard sailor-turned-musician whose playing style centers on sustained, rolling bass notes that mimic ocean swells and harbor sounds. Originally arrived as a ship's musician meant to ward off sea serpents with special harmonics, she now seeks to incorporate Morrowind's unique soundscapes into her maritime compositions.

- DRUM:
	- Ra'jira "Quick-Paws" (Black Shalk Cornerclub, Vivec, Foreign Quarter)
		Hire cost: 300G
		An incredibly energetic Khajiit whose drumming is fast, complex, and infectious. Might offer to join for the thrill of new rhythms and the promise of "much coin for lively beats, yes?"
	- Ulveni Llervu (Andus Tradehouse, Maar Gan)
		Hire cost: ~1000G?
		A stern House Redoran drummer who makes yearly journeys up to the Urshilaku tribe to study their traditional drumming technique. Stoic, Ashlander roots, big on respecting the "old ways".

=============
Installation
=============
1. Place the contents of the archive into your Data Files folder, or add it as a data directory in the OpenMW launcher.
2. Enable "Bardcraft.omwscripts" in your load order.
3. In your OpenMW launcher, go to Settings > Visuals > Animations and make sure "Use Additional Animation Sources" is checked. "Smooth Animation Transitions" is also highly recommended but not required.

========
Removal
========
Remove the mod's files from your Data Files folder or unlink them in the OpenMW launcher.

==================
Incompatibilities
==================
Dynamic Music: If you have background music silencing enabled while performers are playing, I recommend making the re-silence interval shorter because Dynamic Music can override the currently playing music at random.

ReAnimation: Make sure to use the latest (4/7/2025+) version of that mod. Older versions will throw an error and stop this mod's animations from playing.

Compatibility with mods that modify follower AI has not been tested. The mod is highly configurable, though, and you can likely disable most AI features that would cause conflicts.
