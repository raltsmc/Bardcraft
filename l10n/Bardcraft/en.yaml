Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Terrible_1: "By the gods! Was that supposed to be music? Get out of my tavern before you curdle the ale!"
Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Terrible_2: "That sounded like a slaughterfish being strangled. Leave. Now."
Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Terrible_3: "Are you trying to drive away my customers? Fetcher! Guards!"
Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Terrible_Dunmer_1: "N'wah! Silence that infernal racket! Out! Out!"
Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Bad_1: "Right, that's enough of that. Maybe stick to fetching drinks, eh?"

Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Mediocre_1: "Hmm. Well, it wasn't terrible. Wasn't great either. Just... was."
Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Mediocre_2: "You hit some of the notes. Some of the time. Keep practicing, maybe?"
Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Mediocre_3: "It filled the air for a bit, I suppose. Nothing to write home about."
Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Mediocre_4: "Adequate. Barely. You won't make a fortune, but you didn't break any windows."
Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Okay_1: "Not bad, not bad at all. A bit rough around the edges, but you've got potential."
Comments_Publican_FirstPerf_Okay_2: "Alright, that was listenable. Better than half the minstrels that wander through here."
