==================
Recruitable Bards
==================
- LUTE:
	- Strumak gro-Bol (Madach Tradehouse, Gnisis)
		Hire cost: 300G
		An unusually introspective Orc who found solace in the lute after a "disagreement" with his stronghold. Speaks little, but his music is very expressive. Might occasionally grumble about how "true strength is found in accepting sorrow."
	- Camilla of Cheydinhal (Halfway Tavern, Pelagiad)
		Hire cost: 1500G
		A former Imperial court performer now scraping by in Morrowind after a run of bad luck. Constantly name-drops nobility no one here has heard of. Possesses considerable talent, but undersells herself.

- OCARINA:
	- Sees-Silent-Reeds (Arrille's Tradehouse, Seyda Neen)
		Hire cost: 100G
		A calm and patient Argonian who offers cryptic but gentle advice. Claims to have learned all they know from watching the waves on the shores of the Bitter Coast. Fascinated by the player's journey as an outlander.
	- Elara Endre (Mages Guild, Ald'ruhn)
		Hire cost: 300G
		A Breton Mages Guild initiate who finds mathematical beauty in musical scales and modes. Plays her ocarina with precise, almost clinical skill, using it to "explore tonal relationships." Offers to join because she sees the player's band as a "fascinating practical application of harmonic theory." Slightly socially awkward.

- FLUTE:
	- Sargon Assinabi (Varo Tradehouse, Vos)
		Hire cost: 200G
		A recently exiled Ashlander who left his tribe with his flute as one of his few possessions, and has decided to try to find a place in settled culture. Attempting to build a life as a wandering musician, but finding settled folk have little appreciation for solo flutists.

- DRUM:
	- Ra'jira "Quick-Paws" (Black Shalk Cornerclub, Vivec, Foreign Quarter)
		Hire cost: 300G
		An incredibly energetic Khajiit whose drumming is fast, complex, and infectious. Offers to join for the thrill of new rhythms and the promise of "much coin for lively beats, yes?"
	- Rels Llervu (Andus Tradehouse, Maar Gan)
		Hire cost: 1000G
		A stern House Redoran drummer who makes yearly journeys up to the Urshilaku tribe to study their traditional drumming technique. Holds no love for the Ashlanders, but views it as a preserved form of ancient Dunmer percussive tradition, and recognizes its potent martial impact.

- FIDDLE:
	- Lucian Caro (Six Fishes, Ebonheart)
		Hire cost: 1500G
		A classically-trained fiddler (or "vielle" player, as he prefers) of the Imperial Conservatory, stuck in Morrowind on what he calls an "extended sabbatical". Very skilled and highly confident, though not to the point of blatant arrogance. Knows what he's worth, and keeps things strictly professional.

=============
Installation
=============
1. Place the contents of the archive into your Data Files folder, or add it as a data directory in the OpenMW launcher.
2. Enable "Bardcraft.omwscripts" and "Bardcraft.ESP" in your load order.
3. In your OpenMW launcher, go to Settings > Visuals > Animations and make sure "Use Additional Animation Sources" is checked. "Smooth Animation Transitions" is also highly recommended but not required.

=========
Updating
=========
Updating between patches (e.g. 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2): 
	Shouldn't cause any major problems as these updates will not modify the ESP in a breaking way.
Updating between minor versions (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0):
	Generally, should NOT be done on an existing save file; you will risk disappearing followers, duplicate music boxes, etc.

========
Removal
========
Remove the mod's files from your Data Files folder or unlink them in the OpenMW launcher.

==================
Incompatibilities
==================
ReAnimation: Make sure to use the latest (4/7/2025+) version of that mod. Older versions will throw an error and stop this mod's animations from playing.
