Comments_Publican_Terrible_1: "By the gods! Was that supposed to be music? Get out of my tavern before you curdle the ale!"

Comments_Publican_Bad_3: "Was that your first time touching an instrument? It certainly sounded like it. Please stop."
Comments_Publican_Bad_4: "Some people have talent, some people... don't. You, ah... might want to practice. Elsewhere."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_1: "Hmm. Well, it wasn't terrible. Wasn't great either. Just... was."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_2: "You hit some of the notes. Some of the time. Keep practicing, maybe?"
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_3: "It filled the air for a bit, I suppose. Nothing to write home about."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_4: "Adequate. Barely. You won't make a fortune, but you didn't break any windows."
Comments_Publican_Good_1: "Not bad, not bad at all. A bit rough around the edges, but you've got potential."
Comments_Publican_Good_2: "Alright, that was listenable. Better than half the minstrels that wander through here."

Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Terrible_2: "That sounded like a guar trying to sing! It's a simple song, how could you possibly mess it up that badly? Leave. Now."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Terrible_3: "Are you trying to drive away my customers with that racket? It's not even a difficult piece! Fetcher! Guards!"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Terrible_Dunmer_1: "N'wah! Silence that infernal noise! A simple song, and you make it sound like torture! Out! Out!"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_1: "Right, that's enough. Even for a simple tune, that was... rough. Maybe stick to fetching drinks, eh?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_2: "My ears! That's supposed to be an easy one, isn't it? Thanks for... trying. Don't expect coin for that."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_3: "Was that your first time holding a lute? It's a basic melody, serjo. Please stop."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_4: "Some people have talent for simple tunes, some... don't. You, ah... might want to practice this one. A lot. Elsewhere."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_1: "Hmm. You played the simple tune. It wasn't terrible. Wasn't good either. Just... there."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_2: "You hit most of the notes. For a simple song, that's the bare minimum. Keep practicing, maybe?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_3: "It filled the air for a bit, I suppose. It's a common tune, hard to truly butcher, but nothing special."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_4: "Adequate. It's a simple song played simply. You won't make a fortune playing that, but you didn't break any windows."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_1: "Not bad for a simple piece. Cleanly played. Shows you know the basics."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_2: "Alright, that was perfectly listenable. A simple tune done right is still pleasant. Better than some who try."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_3: "A pleasant little ditty. Kept the mood light. Here's a few drakes for your trouble."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_4: "You handled that simple song well. Competent. Maybe try another simple one tomorrow?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Great_1: "Hey, that was played quite well! A simple tune, but you gave it some life. Well done."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Great_2: "Now that's how that simple song should sound! Clean and cheerful. Play another?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Great_3: "Very nice! A familiar tune played skillfully. I think the patrons enjoyed the pleasant sound. We'd be happy to have you play simple songs like that again."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Great_4: "You've got a good ear for melody, even on the simple stuff! Here you go, well-earned for a solid performance."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Excellent_1: "By Azura's Star! You made that simple tune sound like something more! Where did you learn to play with such finesse?"

Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Excellent_3: "Bravo! You took a simple song and made it shine! The crowd enjoyed that. Here, you certainly earned this."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Excellent_4: "Absolutely lovely! Even simple music sounds great when played with your skill. You have real potential, friend. Fancy trying something more challenging next time?"

Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_1: "By Vivec's Scrolls! That was ambitious... and a complete disaster! Get that cacophony out of my tavern before the ancestors weep!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_2: "That sounded like a cliff racer hitting a scrib repeatedly. A noble attempt, perhaps, but stick to simpler tunes, eh? Or better yet, just leave."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_3: "Are you trying to give everyone a headache with that? Painful! Maybe learn the basics before attempting the epics? Guards! Remove this charlatan!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_Dunmer_1: "N'wah! Do you mock our ancient melodies with that screeching? Silence! Out! You disgrace the song's legacy!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_1: "Right, that's enough. A bold choice of song, serjo, but you didn't quite pull it off. Far from it. Maybe stick to something less... intricate?"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_2: "My ears are ringing. I suppose I appreciate the effort on such a difficult piece, but... no. Just no. Don't expect coin for that attempt."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_3: "Some songs demand true mastery. You, ah... haven't quite mastered that one, have you? Needs significant practice. Elsewhere."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_1: "Hmm. A complex piece. You got parts of it right, hit some of the flourishes, but lost the thread elsewhere. It wasn't entirely terrible, considering the difficulty."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_2: "You hit some of the harder passages... and flubbed others badly. Takes guts to try that one in public. Keep practicing, you might get there eventually."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_3: "It filled the air, I suppose. Recognizable as the piece you attempted, at least. But it lacked the fire and precision a song like that needs."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_4: "An adequate attempt at a difficult song. You didn't butcher it beyond recognition, which is something. Better luck next time."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_1: "Not bad! That's a notoriously tricky one, and you handled most of it surprisingly well. You've got clear potential, tackling pieces like that."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_2: "Alright, that was quite listenable, impressive even, considering the complexity. Better than many minstrels who wouldn't even dare try it."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_3: "A respectable rendition of a tricky piece. Kept my attention. Here's a little something for your demonstrated skill."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_4: "You've got some real skill to play that piece even that well. Keep practicing it. I'd like to hear it again when you've perfected it."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Great_1: "Hey, that was genuinely impressive! A difficult song played with real flair and competence. You elevated the atmosphere! Well done!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Great_2: "Now that's skill! Handling those complex parts so smoothly! Got another difficult piece like that one?"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Great_3: "Very nice! A performance worthy of the song's reputation! I think the patrons were genuinely impressed. We'd be happy to have you back, especially if you play like that."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Great_4: "You've got a master's touch for that instrument! Tackling such work and succeeding... Here you go, that was well-earned!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Excellent_1: "By Azura's Star! That was incredible! Such complexity, played flawlessly! Where in Oblivion did you learn to play like that?"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Excellent_2: "Magnificent! Best performance of that epic I've ever heard, here or anywhere! You've got a regular spot here if you want it! Name your price!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Excellent_3: "Bravo! Bravo! The crowd is stunned! Such mastery! You're a true artist! Here, you deserve much more than this paltry sum."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Excellent_4: "Absolutely fantastic! True virtuosity! You didn't just play the notes, you understood the soul of that complex piece! We'd be honored to have you grace our tavern again!"
