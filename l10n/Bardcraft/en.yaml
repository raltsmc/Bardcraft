Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Terrible_3: "That's an easy song! How could you possibly mangle it so badly? My ears are bleeding! Out with you, fetcher!"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Terrible_4: "Pitiful! A child could play that melody. You, apparently, cannot. Begone!"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Terrible_5: "That was an insult to simple music everywhere. Out, now!"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Terrible_Dunmer_1: "N'wah! Silence that infernal noise! A simple song, and you make it sound like torture! Out! Out!"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Terrible_Dunmer_2: "By the Three! Was that supposed to be that simple tune? Get out before you break my windows!"
Comments_Publican_Terrible_1: "By the gods! Was that supposed to be music? Get out of my tavern before you curdle the ale!"
Comments_Publican_Terrible_2: "That sounded like a slaughterfish being strangled. Leave. Now."
Comments_Publican_Terrible_3: "Are you trying to drive away my customers? Fetcher! Guards!"
Comments_Publican_Terrible_4: "My patrons look like they're in physical pain. Stop that noise and get out!"
Comments_Publican_Terrible_5: "Not even background noise for a bar fight. Just awful. Leave."
Comments_Publican_Terrible_6: "I demand compensation for the suffering your 'performance' has inflicted!"
Comments_Publican_Terrible_Dunmer_1: "N'wah! Silence that infernal racket! Out! Out!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_1: "That sounded like a cliff racer hitting a scrib repeatedly. A noble attempt, perhaps, but stick to simpler tunes, eh? Or better yet, just leave."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_2: "Are you trying to give everyone a headache with that? Painful! Maybe learn the basics before attempting the epics? Guards! Remove this charlatan!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_3: "Ambitious choice, but an absolute train wreck! My head! Out!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_4: "You aimed for the moons and hit the mud. Painfully. Please leave."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_5: "That was... a brave attempt at a very difficult piece. And a spectacular failure. Begone!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_6: "It takes skill to make such a grand piece sound that terrible. Impressive, in its own way. Now get out."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_Dunmer_1: "N'wah! Do you mock our ancient melodies with that screeching? Silence! Out! You disgrace the song's legacy!"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_Dunmer_2: "By Vivec's Scrolls! That was ambitious... and a complete disaster! Get that cacophony out of my tavern before the ancestors weep!"

Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_1: "Right, that's enough. Even for a simple tune, that was... rough. Maybe stick to fetching drinks, eh?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_2: "My ears! That's supposed to be an easy one, isn't it? Thanks for... trying. Don't expect coin for that."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_3: "Was that your first time holding a lute? It's a basic melody, serjo. Please stop."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_4: "That's a common tune, and you still stumbled all over it. Practice, friend. Elsewhere."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_5: "You got maybe half the notes right for that simple ditty. Not good enough."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_6: "Even for basic tavern fare, that was... lacking. Significantly."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_7: "It's not a hard song. Try again when you've actually learned it."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_8: "My patrons are wincing. On a simple song! Come on now."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_9: "Unimpressive song, unimpressive performance. Try harder."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_10: "That was just... clumsy. Even for such a straightforward piece."
Comments_Publican_Bad_1: "Right, that's enough of that. Maybe stick to fetching drinks, eh?"
Comments_Publican_Bad_2: "My ears are bleeding. Thanks for... whatever that was. Don't expect coin for it."
Comments_Publican_Bad_3: "Was that your first time touching an instrument? It certainly sounded like it. Please stop."
Comments_Publican_Bad_4: "Some people have talent, some people... don't. You, ah... might want to practice. Elsewhere."
Comments_Publican_Bad_5: "I think I preferred the ambient noise of the tavern, actually."
Comments_Publican_Bad_6: "That wasn't just bad, it was actively unpleasant."
Comments_Publican_Bad_7: "If I wanted to hear that kind of noise, I'd visit a kwama mine during a revolt."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_1: "Right, that's enough. A bold choice of song, serjo, but you didn't quite pull it off. Far from it. Maybe stick to something less... intricate?"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_2: "My ears are ringing. I suppose I appreciate the effort on such a difficult piece, but... no. Just no. Don't expect coin for that attempt."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_3: "Some songs demand true mastery. You, ah... haven't quite mastered that one, have you? Needs significant practice. Elsewhere."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_4: "A noble effort on a challenging piece, but it fell very flat. Very, very flat."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_5: "You've got ambition, I'll give you that. The skill for that song, however, is missing."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_6: "That piece deserves better. Much better. Perhaps practice it for a few more years."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_7: "I can hear what you were trying to do with that complex song. Pity it didn't work out."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_8: "Commendable effort to tackle such a piece, but the execution was... painful to witness."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_9: "Too many missed notes, too many stumbles. That song is out of your league for now."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_10: "You're not ready for that one. It showed. A lot."

Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_1: "Well, you played the simple tune. It wasn't offensive. That's something."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_2: "You hit most of the notes. For a simple song, that's the bare minimum. Keep practicing, maybe?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_3: "It filled the air for a bit, I suppose. It's a common tune, hard to truly butcher, but nothing special."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_4: "Adequate. It's a simple song played simply. You won't make a fortune playing that, but you didn't break any windows."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_5: "Competent enough for what it was. Which wasn't much."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_6: "Filled the air for a moment. With a very simple tune. Fine."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_7: "Well, you didn't butcher it. For such a basic piece, that's the minimum expectation."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_8: "It's a common song, played... commonly. Adequate, I suppose."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_1: "Hmm. Well, it wasn't terrible. Wasn't great either. Just... was."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_2: "You hit some of the notes. Some of the time. Keep practicing, maybe?"
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_3: "It filled the air for a bit, I suppose. Nothing to write home about."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_4: "Adequate. Barely. You won't make a fortune, but you didn't break any windows."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_5: "I've heard worse fill this tavern. And I've certainly heard better."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_6: "A perfectly forgettable performance. Could be worse."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_7: "Passable. The patrons don't look like they're suffering, so there's that."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_1: "Hmm. A complex piece. You got parts of it right, hit some of the flourishes, but lost the thread elsewhere. It wasn't entirely terrible, considering the difficulty."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_2: "You hit some of the harder passages... and flubbed others badly. Takes guts to try that one in public. Keep practicing, you might get there eventually."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_3: "It filled the air, I suppose. Recognizable as the piece you attempted, at least. But it lacked the fire and precision a song like that needs."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_4: "An adequate attempt at a difficult song. You didn't butcher it beyond recognition, which is something. Better luck next time."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_5: "A complex piece like that... you managed parts of it. Some were even listenable."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_6: "I recognize the ambition in trying that one. You got further than some, but it lacked polish."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_7: "Considering the difficulty, that wasn't a total disaster. Just mostly."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_8: "You kept it together for most of that intricate song. Some rough patches, though. Many rough patches."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_9: "That's a beast of a song. You wrestled it to a draw, I'd say. A very messy draw."

Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_1: "Not bad for a simple piece. Cleanly played. Shows you know the basics."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_2: "Alright, that was perfectly listenable. A simple tune done right is still pleasant. Better than some who try."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_3: "A pleasant little ditty. Kept the mood light. Here's a few drakes for your trouble."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_4: "You handled that simple song well. Competent. Maybe try another simple one tomorrow?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_5: "You took a simple tune and played it quite nicely. Well done."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_6: "Cleanly played. Even a basic song sounds good with proper execution."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_7: "Alright, that was a pleasant rendition of that old ditty. Good work."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_8: "Nice! Made that straightforward piece sound quite charming."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_9: "Good to hear a simple song performed with care and skill."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_10: "Solid. You clearly know your way around that instrument, even on the easy stuff."
Comments_Publican_Good_1: "Not bad, not bad at all. A bit rough around the edges, but you've got potential."
Comments_Publican_Good_2: "Alright, that was listenable. Better than half the minstrels that wander through here."
Comments_Publican_Good_3: "Pleasant enough tune. Kept the mood light. Here's a little something for your trouble."
Comments_Publican_Good_4: "You've got some skill. Keep it up, maybe try again tomorrow?"
Comments_Publican_Good_5: "Hey, that was genuinely good! You brightened the place up. Well done!"
Comments_Publican_Good_6: "Very nice! I think the patrons enjoyed that. We'd be happy to have you back."
Comments_Publican_Good_7: "You've got a good ear and nimble fingers! Here you go, well-earned."
Comments_Publican_Good_8: "A solid performance. Definitely raised the spirits in here."
Comments_Publican_Good_9: "That was well worth listening to. Good job, bard."
Comments_Publican_Good_10: "Enjoyable stuff. You've got talent."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_1: "Not bad! That's a notoriously tricky one, and you handled most of it surprisingly well. You've got clear potential, tackling pieces like that."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_2: "Alright, that was quite listenable, impressive even, considering the complexity. Better than many minstrels who wouldn't even dare try it."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_3: "A respectable rendition of a tricky piece. Kept my attention. Here's a little something for your demonstrated skill."
