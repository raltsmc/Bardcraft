Overview
=========


=============
Installation
=============
1. Place the contents of the archive into your Data Files folder, or add it as a data directory in the OpenMW launcher.
2. Enable "Bardcraft.omwscripts" in your load order.
3. In your OpenMW launcher, go to Settings > Visuals > Animations and make sure "Use Additional Animation Sources" is checked. "Smooth Animation Transitions" is also highly recommended but not required.

========
Removal
========
Remove the mod's files from your Data Files folder or unlink them in the OpenMW launcher.

==================
Incompatibilities
==================
Dynamic Music: If you have background music silencing enabled while performers are playing, I recommend making the re-silence interval shorter because Dynamic Music can override the currently playing music at random.

ReAnimation: Make sure to use the latest (4/7/2025+) version of that mod. Older versions will throw an error and stop this mod's animations from playing.

Compatibility with mods that modify follower AI has not been tested. The mod is highly configurable, though, and you can likely disable most AI features that would cause conflicts.
