Comments_Publican_Impressive_Terrible_2: "Are you trying to give everyone a headache with that? Painful! Maybe learn the basics before attempting the epics? Guards! Remove this charlatan!"

Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_1: "Right, that's enough. Even for a simple tune, that was... rough. Maybe stick to fetching drinks, eh?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_2: "My ears! That's supposed to be an easy one, isn't it? Thanks for... trying. Don't expect coin for that."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_3: "Was that your first time holding a lute? It's a basic melody, serjo. Please stop."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Bad_4: "That's a common tune, and you still stumbled all over it. Practice, friend. Elsewhere."

Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_1: "Right, that's enough. A bold choice of song, serjo, but you didn't quite pull it off. Far from it. Maybe stick to something less... intricate?"
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_2: "My ears are ringing. I suppose I appreciate the effort on such a difficult piece, but... no. Just no. Don't expect coin for that attempt."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_3: "Some songs demand true mastery. You, ah... haven't quite mastered that one, have you? Needs significant practice. Elsewhere."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Bad_4: "A noble effort on a challenging piece, but it fell very flat. Very, very flat."

Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Mediocre_4: "Adequate. It's a simple song played simply. You won't make a fortune playing that, but you didn't break any windows."

Comments_Publican_Mediocre_1: "Hmm. Well, it wasn't terrible. Wasn't great either. Just... was."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_2: "You hit some of the notes. Some of the time. Keep practicing, maybe?"
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_3: "It filled the air for a bit, I suppose. Nothing to write home about."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_4: "Adequate. Barely. You won't make a fortune, but you didn't break any windows."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_5: "I've heard worse fill this tavern. And I've certainly heard better."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_6: "A perfectly forgettable performance. Could be worse."
Comments_Publican_Mediocre_7: "Passable. The patrons don't look like they're suffering, so there's that."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_1: "Hmm. A complex piece. You got parts of it right, hit some of the flourishes, but lost the thread elsewhere. It wasn't entirely terrible, considering the difficulty."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_2: "You hit some of the harder passages... and flubbed others badly. Takes guts to try that one in public. Keep practicing, you might get there eventually."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_3: "It filled the air, I suppose. Recognizable as the piece you attempted, at least. But it lacked the fire and precision a song like that needs."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_4: "An adequate attempt at a difficult song. You didn't butcher it beyond recognition, which is something. Better luck next time."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_5: "A complex piece like that... you managed parts of it. Some were even listenable."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_6: "I recognize the ambition in trying that one. You got further than some, but it lacked polish."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_7: "Considering the difficulty, that wasn't a total disaster. Just mostly."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_8: "You kept it together for most of that intricate song. Some rough patches, though. Many rough patches."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Mediocre_9: "That's a beast of a song. You wrestled it to a draw, I'd say. A very messy draw."

Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_1: "Not bad for a simple piece. Cleanly played. Shows you know the basics."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_2: "Alright, that was perfectly listenable. A simple tune done right is still pleasant. Better than some who try."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_3: "A pleasant little ditty. Kept the mood light. Here's a few drakes for your trouble."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_4: "You handled that simple song well. Competent. Maybe try another simple one tomorrow?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Good_5: "You took a simple tune and played it quite nicely. Well done."

Comments_Publican_Good_2: "Alright, that was listenable. Better than half the minstrels that wander through here."
Comments_Publican_Good_3: "Pleasant enough tune. Kept the mood light. Here's a little something for your trouble."
Comments_Publican_Good_4: "You've got some skill. Keep it up, maybe try again tomorrow?"

Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_1: "Not bad! That's a notoriously tricky one, and you handled most of it surprisingly well. You've got clear potential, tackling pieces like that."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_2: "Alright, that was quite listenable, impressive even, considering the complexity. Better than many minstrels who wouldn't even dare try it."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_3: "A respectable rendition of a tricky piece. Kept my attention. Here's a little something for your demonstrated skill."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_4: "You've got some real skill to play that piece even that well. Keep practicing it. I'd like to hear it again when you've perfected it."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_5: "That's a difficult song, and you did it justice for the most part. Solid work."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_6: "The patrons were definitely listening to that one. It's not often we hear such an ambitious piece played competently."

Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_10: "Very good. You made that complex piece quite listenable, which is commendable."
Comments_Publican_Impressive_Good_11: "Now that took some doing! Handling a complex piece that capably shows real promise. Well played."

Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Great_1: "Hey, that was played quite well! A simple tune, but you gave it some life. Well done."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Great_2: "Now that's how that simple song should sound! Clean and cheerful. Play another?"
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Great_3: "Very nice! A familiar tune played skillfully. I think the patrons enjoyed the pleasant sound. We'd be happy to have you play simple songs like that again."
Comments_Publican_Unimpressive_Great_4: "You've got a good ear for melody, even on the simple stuff! Here you go, well-earned for a solid performance."
